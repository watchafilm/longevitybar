    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the SipSwift app's order-taking and management features. It prioritizes authorization independence and efficient data retrieval. Drinks are stored in a top-level `/drinks` collection. Orders are stored in the `/orders` collection, which is accessible to bar staff. To achieve authorization independence, the `orders` collection includes denormalized data like drink information. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules when creating and managing orders. The structure facilitates QAPs (Rules are not Filters) because the rules can be written to allow listing only specific orders based on the denormalized data, without filtering after the query."
